## Overview
A **Python-based Pong game** created using the **Turtle module**.  
This project applies **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts, event handling, and basic 2D game logic.  
Two players control paddles to bounce the ball — the first to miss gives a point to the opponent.

---

## Features
- Two-player paddle control (`W/S` and `↑/↓` keys)
- Ball bounces off walls and paddles
- Gradually increasing ball speed after each hit
- Scoreboard tracks both players’ scores
- Game resets automatically when a point is scored

---

## Installation
Open a terminal (Linux/Mac) or PowerShell/Command Prompt (Windows) and run:


## Requirements
- **Python 3.10+**  
- No external libraries required  
- The game uses Python’s built-in **turtle** module (comes pre-installed with Python)


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hamidreza1324/Pong-Game.git
