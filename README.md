## Overview
A **Python-based Pong game** created using the **Turtle module**.  
This project applies **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts, event handling, and basic 2D game logic.  
Two players control paddles to bounce the ball — the first to miss gives a point to the opponent.  
The game includes a countdown before starting and a first-to-10 game-over condition.

---

## Features
- Two-player paddle control (`W/S` and `↑/↓` keys)
- Ball bounces off walls and paddles
- Gradually increasing ball speed after each hit
- Ball changes color when bouncing
- Countdown before the game starts
- Scoreboard tracks both players’ scores
- First player to reach 10 points wins
- Game resets automatically when a point is scored

---

## Requirements
- **Python 3.12+**
- No external libraries required
- Uses Python's built-in **turtle** module
- Optional: virtual environment recommended

---

## Installation
